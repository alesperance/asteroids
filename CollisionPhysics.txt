Physics of collisions

Classical "Newtonian" Physics
Rigid Body Dynamics
Linear Dynamics
	-motion of an object in a linear fashion
Rotational Dynamics
	-motion of an object on how it rotates
Idealized Point Mass

Energy
	K = kinetic energy (energy from motion relative to the frame of reference)
		K = 1/2mv^2
	U = potential energy (Derived from position and force/force field)
		Ugravity = mgh
		Ugravity = (-GMm)/r where G = gravitational constant = 6.6738*10^-11 m/kg*s^2
		Uspring = 1/2kd where k = spring constant and d = displacement
		
Inside our system:
	Energy = K1 + K2 = 1/2m1v1^2 + 1/2m2v2^2 = 1/2m1v1'^2 + 1/2m2v2'^2
	Momentum: P = mv;  P1 + P2 = m1v1 + m2v2 = m1v1' + m2v2' (vectors)
	
	Epsilon	= coefficient of restitution [0,1]  (multiply equation by epsilon)
	
	
Angular Dynamics
	T = RxF (r cross f)
	Omega = I(alpha)(deltaT)
	F = ma (acc.is vector)
	
For now, we're concerned about calculating the velocity.  We can use a constant for rotational energy
